## Issues Found

- No integration tests for `RemoveFoodPreferenceCommandHandler` (required by project rules)
- API tests for RemoveFoodPreference are failing due to AddFamilyMemberCommand validation error (`UserId is required`)
- Minor whitespace formatting lint errors in several files

## Suggested Improvements
- Add unit tests for `RemoveFoodPreferenceCommandValidator`
- Add integration tests for `RemoveFoodPreferenceCommandHandler`
- Fix test data/setup for API tests to resolve AddFamilyMemberCommand validation error
- Fix whitespace formatting errors (run `dotnet format`)

## Final Verdict
**Fail** (due to missing required tests, failing API tests, and minor lint issues)
