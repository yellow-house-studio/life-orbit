## 2. Implementation Audit

| Check | Item | Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|
| ‚úÖ | Controller is minimal | Only constructs and sends commands via Mediator, returns result |
| ‚úÖ | No validation/business logic in controller | All logic is in handlers/validators |
| ‚úÖ | Correct handlers exist | Both Add and Remove handlers present |
| ‚úÖ | Separate validator classes | Both commands have validators |
| ‚úÖ | No validation in handlers | Handlers do not perform validation, only repository and domain logic |
| ‚úÖ | No transaction control in handlers | Handlers rely on transaction behavior, do not manage transactions directly |
| ‚úÖ | No direct DbContext access in handlers/validators | All data access via repository |
| ‚úÖ | Full file paths listed | All files above |

## 3. Validation Audit

| ‚úÖ | Validator unit tests (AddSafeFood) | Present and comprehensive |
| ‚úÖ | Validator unit tests (RemoveSafeFood) | **Missing** [DONE] |
| ‚úÖ | Validation triggered in integration tests | Integration tests for both handlers cover validation and error cases |

| ‚úÖ | Unit tests for AddSafeFood validator | Present and comprehensive |
| ‚úÖ | Unit tests for RemoveSafeFood validator | **Missing** [DONE] |
| ‚úÖ | All tests run and results documented | See below |

## 6. Project Rule Verification

| Check | Item | Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|

## 7. Build and Linting Audit

| Check | Item | Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|
| ‚ö†Ô∏è | Build warnings | 3 minor warnings (1 ASP.NET Core, 2 obsolete API usage in test auth handler) |
| ‚úÖ | No build errors | Build succeeded |
| ‚úÖ | Linting | No critical linting issues reported |

---

## Issues Found

- **Missing unit tests for RemoveSafeFoodCommandValidator.** [DONE]
- **One failing unit test:** `RemoveSafeFoodCommandHandlerTests.Handle_should_remove_safe_food` (expected not to contain "Apple", but it does). [DONE]
- **Minor build warnings:** Not critical, but should be addressed for long-term health.

---

## Suggested Improvements

- **Add unit tests for RemoveSafeFoodCommandValidator** in `server/YellowHouseStudio.LifeOrbit.Tests.Unit/Application/Family/RemoveSafeFood/RemoveSafeFoodCommandValidatorTests.cs`. [DONE]
- **Fix the failing unit test** in `RemoveSafeFoodCommandHandlerTests` to ensure the handler correctly removes the safe food from the collection in the test mock/setup. [DONE]
- **Address minor build warnings** (update usage of obsolete APIs, review BuildServiceProvider usage).

---

## Final Verdict

**Conditional Pass**  
- The feature is nearly complete and robust, but the audit cannot fully pass until the missing validator unit tests are added and the failing handler unit test is fixed. [DONE]
