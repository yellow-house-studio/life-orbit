# ðŸ“„ Prompt: Fix Errors Based on Audit Report

You are tasked with fixing all issues, faults, and suggestions identified in a given Audit Report.

Follow these rules carefully:

---

## ðŸ”¹ Input Provided
You will be given:
- The **original Audit Report** (Markdown format).

---

## ðŸ”¹ Your Tasks

1. **Go through the Audit Report line by line.**
2. For each **error, fault, or suggestion**:
   - Make the necessary code changes to fix the problem.
   - Keep the fixes clean, following the projectâ€™s coding standards and architecture.
3. After completing each fix:
   - Mark the corresponding Audit Report line by appending **"[DONE]"** at the end of the line.
   - Do **not** remove the original text.
   - Only add **"[DONE]"** after the line item you have corrected.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Rules for Fixing

- **Only mark "[DONE]" if the issue is fully resolved**.
- If fixing an issue requires fixing multiple files, do it properly and completely.
- **Fix all related tests** if the changes affect them.
- **Update Swagger documentation and public comments** if needed.
- **Ensure build and lint warnings are removed** where possible.
- **Rerun all related tests** after each fix to make sure they pass.
- If any suggested improvements make sense to implement, you should also fix them even if they were not critical errors.

---

## ðŸ”¹ After All Fixes

At the end:
- Save the updated Audit Report with "[DONE]" markers.
- Save all updated source code files.
- Confirm that:
  - Build succeeds without critical warnings.
  - Linting passes.
  - All tests pass successfully.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Important

- Work methodically and carefully â€” **do not skip any issues**.
- The final corrected Audit Report should be clean, showing exactly what has been fixed (with "[DONE]") and what was not needed if any.
